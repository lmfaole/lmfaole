## Current tools

### IDE environment

A reserved recommendation of [VSCode][].

**I like a lot of what [WebStorm] is doing**. [WebStorm's integrated version control](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/manage-branches.html#create-branch) is a delight, but I've found that it's ultimately too opinionated for collaboration purposes. The [GitLens extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) is probably the closest you can get on VSCode, but I haven't found it as easy to use (and it's paid).

I try to keep my extensions to a minimum, but these are some of my favorites:

- [Dark Horizon (dark theme)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mcagampan.dark-horizon)
- [Horla (light theme)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Horla.horla-light-theme)
- [Material File Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)
- [Fluent Product Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miguelsolorio.fluent-icons)
- [Biome for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome)

We use [Biome] for linting and formatting on my team, and so far it's been a great replacement for Prettier and ESLint. In addition to this I use the [markdownlint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) as [Biome doesn't fully support markdown yet](https://biomejs.dev/internals/language-support/).

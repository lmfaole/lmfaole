Previously designed components for [NAV] at [Aksel].

## Current tools

### Blogging platform

Markdown + [Eleventy].

### IDE environment

I'll first give a reserved recommendation of [VSCode][]. It's really not my favorite, but the extensive library of extensions make it inevitable at this point.

**My personal favorite is [WebStorm]**. [WebStorm's integrated version control](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/manage-branches.html#create-branch) is a delight, but there aren't nearly enough plugins. Some notable missing ones for me is a good formatter for nunjucks, and a Norwegian language pack.

When I'm using VSCode I try to keep my extensions to a minimum. This is my minimalistic setup:

- [Dark Horizon (dark theme)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mcagampan.dark-horizon)
- [Horla (light theme)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Horla.horla-light-theme)
- [Material File Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)
- [Fluent Product Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miguelsolorio.fluent-icons)
- [Biome for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome)

We use [Biome] for linting and formatting on my team, and so far it's been a great replacement for Prettier and ESLint. In addition to this I use the [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) as [Biome doesn't fully support Markdown yet](https://biomejs.dev/internals/language-support/).

> I turn off all AI features in any IDE. Accidentally learning about something while coding is so much fun, and at the time of writing this Copilot takes that away from me. Intellisense stays on though.

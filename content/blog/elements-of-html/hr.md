## The specification

For being one of the OG's of HTML (Firefox has had support for it since it first launched 🤯), there's really not much to it. The whole thing is described in one (convoluted) sentence:

> The hr element represents a paragraph-level thematic break, e.g., a scene change in a story, or a transition to another topic within a section of a reference book; alternatively, it represents a separator between a set of options of a select element.

I love the ...or a separator between a set of options of a select element. It feels so right and so wrong at the same time. 

<aside>Thank god for <a title="Coming soon ™️">optgroups</a> though.</aside>

## Example

The following paragraph is an excerpt from <cite>Pandora's Star</cite> by Peter F. Hamilton taken from the [HTML spec for the horizontal rule element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-hr-element):

Dudley was ninety-two, in his second life, and fast approaching
time for another rejuvenation. Despite his body having the physical
age of a standard fifty-year-old, the prospect of a long degrading
campaign within academia was one he regarded with dread. For a
supposedly advanced civilization, the Intersolar Commonwealth could be
appallingly backward at times, not to mention cruel.

*Maybe it won't be that bad* he told himself. The lie was
comforting enough to get him through the rest of the night's
shift

<hr />

The Carlton AllLander drove Dudley home just after dawn. Like the
astronomer, the vehicle was old and worn, but perfectly capable of
doing its job. It had a cheap diesel engine, common enough on a
semi-frontier world like Gralmond, although its drive array was a
thoroughly modern photoneural processor. With its high suspension and
deep-tread tyres it could plough along the dirt track to the
observatory in all weather and seasons, including the metre-deep snow
of Gralmond's winters.
